#### Server Averaging for Federated Learning

__George Pu__, Yanlin Zhou, Xiaolin Li, Dapeng Wu<br/>
*arXiv:2103.11619*, Mar 2021

Taking the average of FedAvg iterates accelerates convergence, similar to how averaged SGD has faster rates of convergence compared to SGD.

#### Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Dataset Distillation

Yanlin Zhou*, __George Pu__*, Xiyao Ma, Xiaolin Li, Dapeng Wu<br/>
2020 NeurIPS Workshop on Scalability, Privacy, and Security in Federated Learning (SpicyFL), Dec 2020

Shorter workshop version of [Distilled One-shot Federated Learning](#distilled-one-shot-federated-learning).

\[[NeurIPS 2020 SpicyFL paper](http://icfl.cc/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/YanlinZhou_28_paper_distillation.pdf)\]

#### Distilled One-shot Federated Learning

Yanlin Zhou\*, __George Pu__\*, Xiyao Ma, Xiaolin Li, Dapeng Wu<br/>
*arXiv:2009.07999*, Sep 2020

Used Dataset Distillation to replace weight averaging for federated learning, leading to large communication cost reductions. It is possible to train a working model in only one round of communication.

#### Adaptive leader-follower formation control and obstacle avoidance via deep reinforcement learning

Yanlin Zhou\*, Fan Lu\*, __George Pu__\*, Xiyao Ma, Runhan Sun, Hsi-Yuan Chen, Xiaolin Li<br/>
*IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)*, Nov 2019

Applied deep reinforcement learning to indoor formation control and obstacle avoidance using a pose network and policy network.
