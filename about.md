My name is George Pu, and I am currently a undergraduate student at the University of Florida studying computer science and mathematics (my first ❤️). I post ~monthly about a large scope of computer science topics with an emphasis on machine learning, my area of research. I also write about the occasional non computer science topic. Beyond taking classes, I perform research at the Center for Big Learning under, formerly Dr. Xiaolin Li, now [Dr. Dapeng Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) and have interned at Amazon.
